title: About Me
---

I am a Bioinformatics Scientist (II) at [Somalogic](https://somalogic.com) in the Production Bioinformatics group. My work is focused on full stack development of a data analytics pipeline to enable statistical process control of the SomaScan Assay.  Applications include:
  * ML-based anomaly detection of highly dimensional data with lead generation utilizing graph networks of process and material data followed by downstream impact analysis
  * Scalable quality reporting powered by seamless traversal between abstractions of data from experiment summary statistics to individual SOMAmer stability
  * Creation of proteomic data lakes wherein data provenance is fully maintained for model development in R and neural network training 

The tech stack includes:
  * Python with heavy utilization of the data science libraries
  * Django with Django Rest Framework
  * Celery and RabbitMQ
  * Docker
  * Kubernetes
  * AWS
  * PostgreSQL
  * Neo4j
  * Node.js
  * D3.js and Plotly.js
  * Vue.js with Bootstrap

Before SomaLogic I recieved my PhD from Colorado State University (CSU) with [Dr. Anthony Rapp√©](http://www.chem.colostate.edu/person/?id=901886AF3A006543D9B2E19620DF8A92&sq=t) in computational chemistry where I developed and applied methodologies to elicit enthalpic global minima and reaction pathways. This work was primarily programmed in Fortran 66 and executed on the CRAY at CSU.

I then acquired a bioinformatics post-doctoral position in the Microbiology, Immunology, and Pathology Department with [Dr. Mark Stenglein](https://www.stengleinlab.org/) where I focused on the development of metagenomic analysis tools as well as supporting the NGS Core Facility at CSU.

In my spare time I moonlight as an iOS app developer with my father where we have created an organic chemistry reference app called [TapOChem](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/tap-ochem/id579861146). I like to think of it as the best one out there but that might just be my bias talking.
