I am a Bioinformatics Scientist II at SomaLogic in the Production Bioinformatics group.

* Development of a full stack ETL pipeline in AWS to clean, load, & analyze real-time data from the SOMAscan Platform, IOT data-sources, and multiple internal & enterprise applications via Django/Numpy/Pandas, RabbitMQ, Docker/Kubernetes, & Postgres.

* Engineering multiple solutions in Python to handle & expose large datasets ranging from simple flat file exports to read-only Postgres data lakes for data analytics.
