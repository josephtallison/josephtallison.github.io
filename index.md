I am a Bioinformatics Scientist (II) at SomaLogic in the Production Bioinformatics group. My work has been focused on full stack development of a data analytics pipeline to enable statistical process control of the SOMAscan Assay. Applications include:
  * ML-based anomaly detection of highly dimensional data with lead generation utilizing graph networks of process & material data followed by downstream impact analysis
  * Scalable quality reporting powered by seamless traversal between abstractions of data from experiment summary statistics to individual SOMAmer stability
  * Creation of proteomic data lakes for model development in R & neural network training wherein data provenance is fully maintained

The tech stack includes:
  * Python w/ heavy utilization of the data science libraries
  * Django w/ Django Rest Framework
  * Celery & RabbitMQ
  * Docker
  * Kubernetes
  * AWS
  * PostgreSQL
  * Neo4j
  * Node.js
  * D3.js and Plotly.js
  * Vue.js with Bootstrap

Before SomaLogic I recieved my Ph. D. from CSU with Dr. Anthony Rapp√© in computational chemistry where I developed and applied methodologies to elicit enthalpic global minima and reaction pathways. This work was primarily programmed in Fortran 66 and executed on the CRAY supercomputer at CSU.

I then acquired a post-doctoral position in the Microbiology, Immunology, & Pathology Department where I focused on the development of metagenomic analysis tools as well as supporting the NGS Core Facility.
